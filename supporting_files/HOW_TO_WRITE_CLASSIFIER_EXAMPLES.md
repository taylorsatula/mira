  1. Diversity in phrasing: Create examples with different sentence structures (questions, commands, statements) that express the same intent
  2. Avoid explicit tool mentions: Don't rely on examples that mention the tool by name - focus on functional needs that require the tool's capabilities
  3. Include parameter variations: Show different ways users might describe parameters (e.g., "tomorrow" vs "May 5th" vs "next Tuesday")
  4. Cover complete functionality: Ensure examples cover all operations the tool provides, with emphasis on core features
  5. Use natural language: Write examples as real users would express themselves, not how developers would describe functionality
  6. Balance specificity levels: Include both detailed queries with context and short, direct requests
  7. Add contextual variations: Create examples that reference the same functionality in different contexts or situations
  8. Incorporate common synonyms: Include different words people use to describe the same action (e.g., "schedule", "set up", "arrange", "plan")
  9. Represent edge cases: Include unusual but valid ways users might express related requests
  10. Maintain semantic distinctiveness: Ensure examples clearly belong to this tool and wouldn't trigger other tools
  11. Use temporal variations: For time-sensitive tools like reminders, include various time expressions (relative and absolute)
  12. Include negation examples: Create examples of what the tool should NOT trigger on to improve boundary recognition
  13. Use embeddings for deduplication: Process examples with a similarity threshold to remove near-duplicates
  14. Test with an LLM review: Have an LLM review examples to identify and remove problematic ones
