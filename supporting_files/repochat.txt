> Help me distll my requirements for a tool repository that my LLM can interact with. It will be coded in Python and follow the core tenants in CLAUDE.md. Ask me questions to probe 
  my needs. Don't try to make any implementation during this conversation! We're just talking.

⏺ What specific problem are you trying to solve with this tool repository for your LLM?

> I am trying to create a centralized tool repository that can manage adding/removing/initializing tools stored in my tools/ directory.

⏺ How do you want tools to be discovered? Should they be:
  1. Manually registered in a config file
  2. Automatically discovered based on file structure
  3. A mix of both approaches?

> A mix of both approaches. I would like manual discovery wherein tools could be manually enabled at the beginning of a conversation (perhaps use config.py to define a list of 
  essential tools that are configured when a conversation begins) or injected into the context window mid-conversation. I'd like an auto-discovery feature that dovetails in with 
  manual discovery at the beginning of the conversation. Auto-discovery would just use manual discovery functionality in a loop till every available tool is enabled.

⏺ That makes sense. A few more questions:

  1. Do your tools need to share any common interface or base class?
  2. How should tool dependencies be handled if one tool requires another?
  3. Do you need versioning support for your tools?
  4. What error handling do you want if a tool fails to load or initialize?

> 1: Yes, I'd like them to share a common Tool class.
  2: The initializer should investigate what dependencies the tool says it has (tools should keep track of their own dependencies and present them in a way the initalizer can process
   them)
  3: No.
  4: It should throw an error and continue to try to initalize other tools.

⏺ Thanks for the details. A few more questions to clarify:

  1. How should tools indicate their dependencies - through a class attribute, method, or configuration?
  2. Should tools be able to be disabled/enabled during a conversation, or only at initialization?
  3. Do you need any logging or monitoring capabilities for tool usage?
  4. Any specific threading or async requirements for tool execution?

> 1: Review tools/questionnaire_tool.py and follow the pattern in that file.
  2: It is very important to expose the ability to enable/disable tools mid-conversation
  3: Basic logging of init, adding, removing, errors.
  4: Already exists but may need to be tweaked. Review tools/async_manager.py and tools/async_tools.py

> Don't expand your scope past the files I explictly specify in my messages. Those other files are irrelevant (hence the .dep extensions) and should be forgotten. 

⏺ Understood. I'll only focus on the files you explicitly specify.

> Good. Continue.

⏺ A few more questions about your repository requirements:

  1. Should tools have metadata like version, author, or dependencies outside other tools?
  2. How do you want to handle initialization failures? Log and continue, stop all tool loading, or some other approach?
  3. Any specific requirements for the repository API (methods it should expose)?

> 1: Basic metadata but only enough to keep good records
  2: Log and continue
  3: It should expose the ability to add tools to the context window & remove tools from the context window. The api should be structured in a way where new functionality can be 
  added on later as needed.

⏺ Thanks for clarifying. To summarize what I understand about your tool repository requirements:

  1. Structure:
    - Base Tool class with common interface
    - Tools store their own dependencies
    - Mix of manual and automatic tool discovery
  2. Functionality:
    - Enable/disable tools mid-conversation
    - Basic dependency resolution
    - Graceful error handling (log and continue)
    - Basic metadata tracking
  3. API Requirements:
    - Add tools to context window
    - Remove tools from context window
    - Flexible for future extensions
    - Basic logging

  Should the repository provide any methods for listing available tools or querying tool status (enabled/disabled)?

> A list of tools should be stored at data/tools/tool_list.json. There should be a basic ability to see if a tool is currently enabled (in the context window) or disabled.

⏺ Got it. To finalize the requirements:

  1. Storage:
    - List of available tools stored at data/tools/tool_list.json
  2. Status Management:
    - Method to check if a tool is enabled/disabled
    - Methods to enable/disable specific tools

  Would you like me to outline a high-level API design for your tool repository based on these requirements? This could include the key classes, methods, and how they would interact.

✻ Thinking…

  Let's create a detailed outline for the high-level API design of the tool repository based on the requirements we've gathered. I'll focus on designing a clean, flexible 
  architecture that meets the current needs while allowing for future extensions.

  First, let's start by defining the core components:

  1. Base Tool Class
  2. Tool Repository Class
  3. Tool Manager Class (for managing enabled/disabled state)

  Let's design each in detail:

  1. Base Tool Class

  The Tool class will serve as the base class for all tools in the system, providing a common interface and shared functionality:

  class Tool:
      """
      Base class for all tools in the system.
      
      All tools must inherit from this class and implement the required interface.
      """
      # Class-level properties/metadata
      name: str = "base_tool"  # Tool name (required)
      description: str = "Base tool class"  # Description of tool functionality
      usage_examples: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []  # Example usage patterns
      dependencies: List[str] = []  # Tool dependencies
      
      def __init__(self):
          """Initialize the tool."""
          self.logger = logging.getLogger(f"tool.{self.name}")
      
      def run(self, **kwargs) -> Any:
          """
          Execute the tool functionality.
          
          Args:
              **kwargs: Tool-specific parameters
              
          Returns:
              Tool execution result
          """
          raise NotImplementedError("Tool subclasses must implement 'run' method")
      
      @classmethod
      def get_tool_definition(cls) -> Dict[str, Any]:
          """
          Get the tool definition for context window.
          
          Returns:
              Tool definition dictionary
          """
          return {
              "name": cls.name,
              "description": cls.description,
              "input_schema": cls.get_parameter_schema(),
              "examples": cls.usage_examples
          }
      
      @classmethod
      def get_parameter_schema(cls) -> Dict[str, Any]:
          """
          Get parameter schema based on type hints.
          
          Returns:
              Parameter schema as dictionary
          """
          # Implementation...

  This base class provides:
  - Common properties all tools must define (name, description)
  - Basic initialization with logging
  - Abstract interface (run method) that must be implemented
  - Helper methods for getting tool definitions and parameter schemas

  2. Tool Repository Class

  The ToolRepository class will manage tool discovery, registration, and dependency resolution:

  class ToolRepository:
      """
      Central registry and manager for all tools in the system.
      
      Handles tool discovery, registration, and dependency resolution.
      """
      
      def __init__(self, tools_package: str = "tools", initial_dependencies: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
          """
          Initialize the tool repository.
          
          Args:
              tools_package: Python package where tools are located
              initial_dependencies: Initial dependencies for tool initialization
          """
          self.logger = logging.getLogger("tool_repo")
          self.tools_package = tools_package
          
          # Storage for tool classes and instances
          self.tool_classes: Dict[str, Type[Tool]] = {}  # Original tool classes
          self.tool_instances: Dict[str, Tool] = {}  # Initialized instances
          
          # Tool status tracking
          self.enabled_tools: Set[str] = set()  # Tools enabled in context window
          
          # Dependency management
          self.dependencies: Dict[str, Any] = {}
          self.tool_requirements: Dict[str, List[str]] = {}
          self.initialization_status: Dict[str, str] = {}  # "pending", "initialized", "failed"
          
          # Register initial dependencies
          if initial_dependencies:
              for name, dependency in initial_dependencies.items():
                  self.register_dependency(name, dependency)
      
      def discover_tools(self, auto_enable: bool = False) -> List[str]:
          """
          Discover all available tools in the tools package.
          
          Args:
              auto_enable: Whether to automatically enable discovered tools
              
          Returns:

          """

          Returns:

          Args:

          """

      def enable_tool(self, tool_name: str) -> bool:
          """

          return tool_name in self.enabled_tools

          """
          # Implementation...
      
      def invoke_tool(self, tool_name: str, tool_params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
          """
          Invoke a tool by name with parameters.
          
          Args:

              tool_params: Parameters to pass to the tool

          # Implementation...

  This class provides:
  - Tool discovery and registration
  - Tool initialization with dependency resolution
  - Tool enabling/disabling in context window
  - Tool invocation with parameter validation
  - Dependency registration
  - Persistence of tool list

  3. Additional Helper Functions

  In addition to the main classes, we'll need some helper functions:

  def create_tool_repository(initial_config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> ToolRepository:
      """
      Create and initialize a tool repository with standard configuration.
      
      Args:
          initial_config: Optional configuration overrides
          
      Returns:
          Initialized ToolRepository
      """
      # Implementation...

  def get_default_dependencies() -> Dict[str, Any]:
      """
      Get the default dependencies for tool initialization.
      
      Returns:
          Dictionary of default dependencies
      """
      # Implementation...

  API Usage Examples

  Let's provide some examples of how this API would be used:

  1. Initializing the Repository
  # Create a tool repository
  repo = create_tool_repository()

  # Discover available tools
  discovered_tools = repo.discover_tools()
  print(f"Discovered {len(discovered_tools)} tools")

  # Enable specific tools for the conversation
  repo.enable_tool("questionnaire_tool")
  repo.enable_tool("persistence_tool")

  2. Using Tools Mid-Conversation
  # Get tool definitions for enabled tools
  enabled_tools = repo.get_enabled_tool_definitions()

  # Enable additional tools when needed
  repo.enable_tool("extraction_tool")

  # Check if a tool is enabled
  if repo.is_tool_enabled("persistence_tool"):
      # Invoke the tool
      result = repo.invoke_tool("persistence_tool", {
          "operation": "get_data",
          "key": "user_preferences"
      })

  3. Managing Tools During Conversation
  # Disable a tool when no longer needed
  repo.disable_tool("extraction_tool")

  # Add a new dependency if needed
  repo.register_dependency("database_connection", db_conn)

  # Enable a tool that requires the new dependency
  repo.enable_tool("database_tool")

  Tool Example Implementation

  To illustrate how a tool would be implemented using this API:

  class ExampleTool(Tool):
      """
      Example tool that demonstrates the Tool interface.
      """
      
      name = "example_tool"
      description = "An example tool that demonstrates the interface"
      dependencies = ["llm_bridge"]  # This tool depends on the LLM bridge
      usage_examples = [
          {
              "input": {"message": "Hello world"},
              "output": {"result": "Processed: Hello world"}
          }
      ]
      
      def __init__(self, llm_bridge):
          """
          Initialize the example tool.
          
          Args:
              llm_bridge: LLM bridge dependency
          """
          super().__init__()
          self.llm_bridge = llm_bridge
          
      def run(self, message: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
          """
          Run the example tool.
          
          Args:
              message: Message to process
              
          Returns:
              Dictionary with processed result
          """
          self.logger.info(f"Processing message: {message}")
          return {"result": f"Processed: {message}"}

⏺ Tool Repository API Design

  Core Components

  1. Base Tool Class

  class Tool:
      # Class-level metadata
      name: str = "base_tool"  # Required
      description: str = "Base tool class"  # Functional description
      dependencies: List[str] = []  # Tool dependencies

  Example Usage Flows

  Initializing and Discovering Tools

  # Create repository with core dependencies
  repo = ToolRepository(initial_dependencies={"llm_bridge": llm_bridge})

  # Discover all tools
  discovered_tools = repo.discover_tools()
  print(f"Discovered {len(discovered_tools)} tools")

  # Or manually enable specific tools
  repo.enable_tool("questionnaire_tool")
  repo.enable_tool("persistence_tool")

  Mid-Conversation Tool Management

  # Add a new tool mid-conversation
  repo.enable_tool("extraction_tool")

  # Check if a tool is available
  if repo.is_tool_enabled("persistence_tool"):
      # Use the tool
      result = repo.invoke_tool("persistence_tool", {"operation": "get_data", "key": "user_prefs"})

  # Remove a tool when no longer needed
  repo.disable_tool("extraction_tool")

  Tool Implementation Example

  class ExampleTool(Tool):
      name = "example_tool"
      description = "Demonstrates the tool interface"
      dependencies = ["llm_bridge"]  # Dependencies declared here

      def __init__(self, llm_bridge):
          super().__init__()
          self.llm_bridge = llm_bridge

      def run(self, message: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
          self.logger.info(f"Processing: {message}")
          return {"result": f"Processed: {message}"}

  Key Design Features

  1. Dependency Resolution
    - Tools declare their own dependencies
    - Repository injects dependencies during initialization
    - Handles cascading dependencies between tools
  2. Flexible Discovery
    - Support for both manual and auto-discovery
    - Tools can be enabled individually or in batches
  3. Runtime Management
    - Add/remove tools mid-conversation
    - Status tracking of enabled/disabled tools
  4. Error Handling
    - Graceful failure with logging
    - Continue initialization despite individual tool failures
  5. Persistence
    - Tool list stored in standard location
    - Easy serialization of tool metadata
