> I'm having some issues with adding tools to the context window dynamically. Specifically the speed at which the "I need a tool to 
  do xyz" is parsed and a new tool is added to the context window. Previously I was using a version of my tool_finder tool that 
  loaded all the descriptions into a prompt and the users request and then sent that off to the llm to pick the correct one. It was 
  usually correct except it would often take 5+ seconds. In an attempt to remedy the issue I switched to using embeddings and 
  matching the users query against descriptions for tools. This was also slow even on a powerful computer so it replaced API latency 
  with compute time. Ultrathink on my problem and alternative approaches that I could take to dynamically add tools to the context 
  window based on what is needed at that moment without a significant time delay. I'll take your response and think on it while I'm 
  at work today and get back to you with the approach I want to take. When providing your report to me please give detailed pros and 
  cons to each approach you propose.

✻ Thinking…

  I need to explore different approaches for dynamically adding tools to a context window based on user needs without significant 
  time delay. Let's analyze the current approaches the user has tried and then brainstorm alternatives.

  Current Approaches and Their Issues:

  1. LLM-based Tool Selection:
    - Sending all tool descriptions to an LLM along with the user's request for the LLM to select the appropriate tool.
    - Issue: Takes 5+ seconds to process, creating noticeable latency.
  2. Embedding-based Matching:
    - Using embeddings to match user queries against tool descriptions.
    - Issue: Still slow even on powerful hardware - traded API latency for local compute time.

  Let's explore alternative approaches:

  Alternative Approaches:

  1. Hierarchical Classification System:
    - Create a two-level system where:
        - Level 1: Use a lightweight classifier to identify the broad category/domain of tools needed.
      - Level 2: Only load and match against tools in the identified category.
    - This reduces the search space dramatically.
  2. Cached Pre-computed Embeddings with Approximate Nearest Neighbors:
    - Pre-compute embeddings for all tool descriptions.
    - Use approximate nearest neighbors algorithms (like FAISS, Annoy, or ScaNN) for fast retrieval.
    - These libraries are optimized for quick similarity searches, even with thousands of items.
  3. Keyword-Based Heuristic Matching:
    - Create a keyword index for each tool (manually or automatically extracted).
    - Use TF-IDF or BM25 to quickly rank tools based on keyword matches.
    - This is much faster than embedding-based methods for smaller datasets.
  4. Client-Side Tool Registry with Pattern Matching:
    - Keep a client-side registry of tools with their capabilities.
    - Use regex or pattern matching on user queries to quickly identify tool needs.
    - Can be combined with fuzzy matching for more flexibility.
  5. Hybrid Approach: Rules + ML:
    - Implement a set of fast rules/heuristics for common tool requests.
    - Fall back to an ML approach only when the rules don't yield high-confidence matches.
    - The rules handle 80% of cases instantly, ML handles the 20% edge cases.
  6. Predictive Pre-loading:
    - Analyze conversation context to predict which tools might be needed next.
    - Pre-load likely tools in the background before they're explicitly requested.
    - When a tool request comes, there's a good chance it's already loaded.
  7. Distributed Tool Selection:
    - Run multiple small, fast tool classifiers in parallel.
    - Each classifier specializes in a specific domain or type of tool.
    - Aggregate their decisions for the final tool selection.
  8. Progressive Tool Loading:
    - Start with a small set of commonly used tools.
    - As the conversation progresses, dynamically adjust the available tool set based on the context.
    - This keeps the tool selection space smaller at any given time.
  9. Local Small Model for Classification:
    - Use a tiny, specialized model specifically trained for tool classification.
    - Deploy it locally for minimal latency (models like TinyBERT or DistilBERT).
    - The specialized nature means faster inference times.
  10. Decision Tree for Tool Selection:
    - Build a decision tree based on common patterns in tool requests.
    - Decision trees are extremely fast at runtime.
    - Can be manually crafted or learned from past interactions.

  For each of these approaches, I'll analyze the pros and cons in detail.

  Let me provide a comprehensive analysis of each approach:

  1. Hierarchical Classification System

  Pros:
  - Reduced Search Space: By first identifying the general category, you only need to search within a subset of tools.
  - Faster Response Time: The initial classifier can be very lightweight and fast.
  - Scalable: Works well even as the number of tools grows, as the hierarchical structure mitigates the impact.
  - Can Use Simple Models: The first-level classifier can be a simple model or even rule-based.
  - Better Accuracy: By narrowing the domain, the second-level matching has less chance of confusion between similar tools from 
  different domains.

  Cons:
  - Category Boundary Issues: Some tools might span multiple categories, making classification difficult.
  - Development Overhead: Requires designing and maintaining the category hierarchy.
  - Multiple Model Calls: Might still require multiple model inferences, adding some latency.
  - Training Data Needs: Requires training data for each level of the hierarchy.
  - Error Propagation: If the first level misclassifies, the correct tool won't even be considered in the second level.

  2. Cached Pre-computed Embeddings with Approximate Nearest Neighbors

  Pros:
  - Extremely Fast Retrieval: ANN libraries like FAISS can search millions of vectors in milliseconds.
  - High Accuracy: Maintains the semantic understanding benefits of embeddings.
  - Scalable: Performance remains good even with many tools.
  - One-time Processing: Embeddings only need to be computed once for each tool.
  - Memory Efficient: Modern ANN libraries have good memory optimization.

  Cons:
  - Implementation Complexity: Requires setting up and tuning the ANN library.
  - Cold Start Cost: Initial embedding computation for all tools still takes time.
  - Embedding Quality Dependency: Performance depends on the quality of your embedding model.
  - Memory Usage: Still requires keeping all embeddings in memory for optimal performance.
  - Updates Require Reprocessing: When tools change, you need to recompute their embeddings.

  3. Keyword-Based Heuristic Matching

  Pros:

  - Interpretable: Easy to understand why a match was made.
  - No ML Dependencies: Works without any ML models or embedding services.
  - Minimal Resource Usage: Very light on CPU and memory.
  - Easy to Update: Adding keywords for new tools is straightforward.

  Cons:
  - Limited Semantic Understanding: Misses nuances that embedding models capture.
  - Requires Manual Keyword Selection: Someone needs to define the keywords for each tool.
  - Sensitive to Wording: User must use similar wording to the defined keywords.
  - Harder to Handle Synonyms: Needs explicit synonym lists or additional processing.
  - May Have False Positives: Different tools with overlapping keywords can be confused.

  4. Client-Side Tool Registry with Pattern Matching

  Pros:
  - Very Low Latency: Pattern matching is extremely fast.
  - No External Dependencies: Everything runs locally.
  - Predictable Performance: Not dependent on external API calls.
  - Fine-Grained Control: Patterns can be highly customized for specific tool invocations.
  - Easy Debugging: When a pattern fails to match, it's clear why.

  Cons:
  - Limited Flexibility: Patterns need to anticipate all ways users might request a tool.
  - Maintenance Overhead: Patterns need to be updated as tools change or new request forms emerge.
  - Difficult to Handle Ambiguity: Hard to determine intent when multiple patterns match.
  - Development Time: Creating good patterns requires significant upfront work.
  - Less Adaptable: Doesn't learn from user interactions over time.

  5. Hybrid Approach: Rules + ML

  Pros:
  - Speed for Common Cases: Fast rules handle the majority of requests instantly.
  - Accuracy for Edge Cases: ML backup handles unusual or complex requests.
  - Resource Efficiency: Only uses heavyweight ML when necessary.
  - Incremental Improvement: Can gradually move common ML patterns to rules over time.
  - Graceful Degradation: If ML service is unavailable, basic functionality still works through rules.

  Cons:
  - System Complexity: Managing both rule-based and ML systems increases complexity.
  - Maintenance of Two Systems: Need to keep both systems in sync and updated.
  - Decision Boundary: Determining when to use rules vs. ML can be tricky.
  - Potential Inconsistency: Rules and ML might give different results for similar queries.
  - Higher Development Cost: Requires implementing and tuning both approaches.

  6. Predictive Pre-loading

  Pros:
  - Perceived Instant Response: Tools are often already loaded when requested.
  - Utilizes Idle Time: Does work during conversation lulls.
  - Improves with Usage: Can learn common tool sequences over time.
  - No User-Visible Latency: Processing happens in the background.
  - Can Prioritize Resources: Allocate more resources to likely-needed tools.

  Cons:
  - Prediction Errors: May load the wrong tools, wasting resources.
  - Resource Usage: Loads tools that might not be used.
  - Complex Prediction Logic: Requires sophisticated context understanding.
  - Cold Start Problem: Not effective until enough context is available.
  - Implementation Complexity: Requires background processing and resource management.

  7. Distributed Tool Selection

  Pros:
  - Parallel Processing: Multiple classifiers work simultaneously.
  - Domain Specialization: Each classifier can be optimized for specific tool types.
  - Fault Tolerance: If one classifier fails, others still function.
  - Easier Maintenance: Classifiers can be updated independently.
  - Scalable: New classifiers can be added for new tool categories.

  Cons:
  - System Complexity: Managing multiple classifiers adds overhead.
  - Result Aggregation Challenges: Need logic to combine and prioritize results.
  - Resource Usage: Running multiple classifiers uses more resources.
  - Potential Conflicts: Different classifiers might suggest contradictory tools.
  - Coordination Overhead: Ensuring all classifiers stay in sync requires extra work.

  8. Progressive Tool Loading

  Pros:
  - Always Fast Start: Initial set of common tools is always ready.
  - Adapts to Conversation: Tool set evolves based on actual needs.
  - Resource Efficient: Only loads what's likely to be needed.
  - Personalization Potential: Can adapt to individual user patterns over time.
  - Simplifies Initial Matching: Smaller tool set means faster initial matching.

  Cons:
  - May Miss Unexpected Needs: If a rarely used tool is suddenly needed, it's not preloaded.
  - Context Management Overhead: Tracking conversation state to predict tool needs.
  - Tool Set Boundary Decisions: Determining which tools to include in the initial set.
  - Potential Delay for New Tools: First use of a non-loaded tool still has latency.
  - Implementation Complexity: Managing the dynamic tool set requires careful design.

  9. Local Small Model for Classification

  Pros:
  - Low Latency: Small models are much faster than full-size LLMs.
  - No External API Dependencies: Everything runs locally.
  - Purpose-Built Accuracy: Can be trained specifically for tool classification.
  - Predictable Performance: Not dependent on external service availability.
  - Resource Efficient: Much smaller memory and compute footprint than general LLMs.

  Cons:
  - Limited Capabilities: Smaller models have less semantic understanding.
  - Training Requirements: Needs training data specific to your tool set.
  - Maintenance Overhead: Model needs retraining as tool set changes.
  - Implementation Complexity: Requires ML deployment and management infrastructure.
  - Less Flexible: More difficult to adapt to new types of requests without retraining.

  10. Decision Tree for Tool Selection

  Pros:
  - Extremely Fast Execution: Decision trees are among the fastest classifiers.
  - Highly Interpretable: Easy to understand why a decision was made.
  - Low Resource Usage: Minimal memory and CPU requirements.
  - No ML Infrastructure Needed: Can be implemented with simple if-else logic.
  - Deterministic Behavior: Same input always produces the same output.

  Cons:
  - Limited Nuance: Can't capture complex semantic relationships.
  - Rigid Structure: Doesn't adapt well to unforeseen request patterns.
  - Manual Creation Effort: Building a comprehensive tree requires significant effort.
  - Maintenance Challenges: Tree needs updating as tools change or new request patterns emerge.
  - Scalability Issues: Trees become unwieldy as the number of tools grows.

  Let me also think about a few more innovative approaches:

  11. Tool Intent Classification + Tool Registry

  Pros:
  - Separates Intent from Tool Selection: First identify what the user wants to do, then match to available tools.
  - More Flexible: Can map multiple intents to the same tool or vice versa.
  - Adaptable to Tool Changes: Tool registry can be updated without changing the intent classifier.
  - Better User Experience: Can handle cases where a user asks for functionality without knowing the specific tool.
  - Reusable Components: Intent classification can be used for other purposes in the system.

  Cons:
  - Two-Stage Process: Adds potential latency from the two-step approach.
  - Intent Design Challenges: Defining the right set of intents is complex.
  - Mapping Maintenance: Need to maintain the intent-to-tool mappings.
  - May Still Require ML: For good intent classification, may still need ML components.
  - Edge Cases: Some user requests might span multiple intents.

  12. Tool Usage Frequency Optimization

  Pros:
  - Prioritizes Common Tools: Most frequently used tools are matched first and fastest.
  - Adapts Over Time: Automatically adjusts as usage patterns change.
  - Simple Implementation: Just requires tracking usage statistics.
  - Resource Efficient: Puts resources where they're most likely to be needed.
  - Improves with Use: System gets faster as it learns the common patterns.

  Cons:
  - Cold Start Problem: No optimization possible for new systems without usage data.
  - Bias Toward History: May be slow to adapt to changing user needs.
  - Rare But Important Tools: Infrequently used but critical tools might be deprioritized.
  - User-Specific Patterns: Different users might have different tool usage patterns.
  - Tracking Overhead: Requires maintaining and analyzing usage statistics.

  13. Context-Aware Tool Filtering

  Pros:
  - Reduces Search Space: Only consider tools relevant to the current conversation.
  - More Accurate Matching: Less chance of confusion between similar tools in different contexts.
  - Faster Processing: Fewer tools to compare means quicker results.
  - Better User Experience: Tools suggested are more likely to be contextually appropriate.
  - Can Use Simpler Matching: With a smaller set, even basic matching can be effective.

  Cons:
  - Context Understanding Needed: Requires good analysis of the conversation state.
  - Missed Opportunities: Might filter out useful tools if context is misjudged.
  - Implementation Complexity: Tracking and utilizing context adds complexity.
  - State Management: Requires maintaining conversation state across interactions.
  - Context Boundaries: Determining when context has changed is challenging.

  14. Tool Description Optimization

  Pros:
  - Faster Matching: Well-designed descriptions lead to faster and more accurate matching.
  - Zero Infrastructure Changes: Just refine the descriptions, no system changes needed.
  - Improved Accuracy: Clearer descriptions reduce ambiguity in matching.
  - No Additional Latency: Doesn't add any processing steps.
  - Simple Implementation: Just a content change, not a technical one.

  Cons:
  - Manual Effort: Requires carefully crafting each tool description.
  - Domain Expertise Needed: Writers need to understand both the tools and user psychology.
  - Limited Gains: There's a ceiling to how much improvement this alone can provide.
  - Maintenance Burden: Descriptions need updating as tools evolve.
  - Doesn't Solve Structural Issues: If the matching system itself is slow, this won't fix it.

  15. Tool-Specific Fast Path Routing

  Pros:
  - Ultra-Fast for Common Patterns: Recognizes specific tool requests instantly.
  - Bypasses General Processing: Skips slower general-purpose matching for known patterns.
  - Highly Optimized: Can be tuned for the most frequent tool requests.
  - Low Resource Usage: Fast paths use minimal processing.
  - Graceful Fallback: Can still use standard processing for unmatched requests.

  Cons:
  - Limited Coverage: Only works for anticipated request patterns.
  - Implementation Effort: Each fast path needs custom implementation.
  - Maintenance Challenges: Fast paths need updating as tools or common requests change.
  - Potential Inconsistencies: Behavior might differ between fast path and standard processing.
  - Testing Complexity: Ensuring fast paths and standard paths produce consistent results.

  Based on all these approaches, I think several combinations could work well for the user's needs. Let me now focus on identifying 
  the most promising approaches given the user's specific constraints: needing fast tool selection without significant delay.

  Some of the most practical approaches for the user's situation appear to be:

  1. Cached Embeddings with ANN: If they're already using embeddings, optimizing with a proper ANN library could dramatically improve
   performance.
  2. Hybrid Approach: Implementing fast rules for common cases with embedding fallback could give both speed and flexibility.
  3. Tool Description Optimization + Lightweight Classification: Refining descriptions combined with a simpler, faster classifier 
  might be sufficient.
  4. Progressive Tool Loading: Starting with common tools and dynamically adjusting based on conversation context could provide good 
  balance.
  5. Tool Intent Classification: Separating "what the user wants to do" from "which tool does it" might simplify the matching 
  problem.

  I'll provide detailed analysis of these in my response, focusing on practical implementation aspects and addressing the user's 
  specific needs around performance.

  Now let me pull together a comprehensive response that lays out these options with their pros and cons, focusing on:
  1. Implementation complexity
  2. Expected performance gains 
  3. Resource requirements
  4. Maintenance considerations
  5. Scalability as the tool set grows

  This should give the user a thorough understanding of their options to consider while at work.

⏺ I'll explore some alternative approaches for dynamically adding tools to your context window with minimal delay:

  1. Cached Embeddings with Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)

  Pros:
  - Extremely fast retrieval (milliseconds) once set up
  - Maintains semantic understanding benefits

  - Can improve over time by converting common ML patterns to rules
  - Continues working if ML service is temporarily unavailable

  Cons:
  - Increased complexity managing two systems
  - Requires maintaining both rule sets and ML components
  - Determining when to use rules vs ML requires careful design
  - Potential inconsistency between rule and ML responses

  3. Tool Intent Classification

  Pros:
  - Separates "what user wants to do" from "which tool does it"
  - Smaller classification task that can be very fast
  - More flexible when tool capabilities overlap
  - Better handles cases where users don't know specific tool names
  - Can use a tiny specialized model for just intent classification

  Cons:
  - Two-step process adds some latency

  - Can incorporate synonym expansion for flexibility

  Cons:
  - Limited semantic understanding
  - Requires careful keyword selection for each tool
  - More sensitive to specific wording than embedding approaches
  - May struggle with novel phrasings of requests

  I recommend considering your specific constraints (latency requirements, hardware limitations, number of tools) when selecting an
  approach. A hybrid solution combining elements from multiple approaches often works best in practice.

> Would you like me to provide an example workflow for my usecase?

⏺ Yes, an example workflow for your specific use case would be very helpful. It would allow me to tailor recommendations more
  precisely to your needs and constraints.

> The User: I need to check my email
  The AI: <inner monologue>The user needs to check their email but I don't have a tool enabled to do that. Let me check the available
   tools.</inner monologue>
  Tool: User="I need to check my email". Tools in repository=spaghetti_tool, math_tool, orangejuice_tool, imap_tool. Task=pick the 
  best tool"
  Tool decision: Enable imap tool
  The AI: <inner monologue>Great. Here are your most recent messages....[...]

⏺ Thank you for the example workflow! This helps clarify your use case - you're looking for a system where:

  1. The AI recognizes it needs a specific tool that's not currently enabled
  2. The system quickly identifies the appropriate tool from a repository
  3. The tool is enabled and added to the context window
  4. The AI can then use the tool to respond to the user

  Based on this workflow, here are refined recommendations:

  1. Pre-indexed Tool Metadata with Fast Lookup

  Pros:
  - Sub-100ms lookup times with minimal processing
  - Store tool metadata (name, description, keywords, capabilities) in a structured format
  - Simple regex or keyword matching can identify high-confidence matches immediately
  - No ML inference latency for common requests

  Cons:
  - Less flexible with novel phrasing
  - Requires maintaining good metadata for each tool
  - May struggle with ambiguous requests

  2. Two-tier Classification System

  Pros:
  - Fast first-pass using lightweight classifiers (even decision trees)
  - Categorizes requests into high-level capability domains (email, scheduling, math, etc.)
  - Narrows search space dramatically before more specific matching
  - Can handle most requests in <200ms

  Cons:
  - Requires defining and maintaining capability categories
  - Two-step process adds some complexity
  - Still needs tool-to-category mapping

  3. Tool Capability Vectors

  Pros:
  - Represent tools as capability vectors rather than just descriptions
  - Much smaller dimensionality than full text embeddings
  - Extremely fast comparison with user request
  - Handles overlapping tool capabilities gracefully
  - Works well with just 10-20 dimensions for most toolsets

  Cons:
  - Requires defining capability dimensions
  - Less precise than full semantic matching
  - Initial setup requires some manual work

  4. Pattern-based Tool Dispatcher

  Pros:
  - Uses pattern recognition to immediately identify tool needs
  - Can use regex patterns for ultra-fast matching
  - No ML latency for common patterns
  - Extremely low resource usage
  - Handles most common requests in <50ms

  Cons:
  - Less flexible with unexpected phrasings
  - Requires maintaining pattern libraries
  - May miss novel request formats

  5. In-memory Tool Registry with Specialized Indexing

  Pros:
  - Keep all tool metadata in memory in optimized data structures
  - Use specialized text search algorithms like BM25 or TF-IDF
  - Can achieve <50ms lookups with proper indexing
  - More flexible than pure pattern matching
  - Libraries like Tantivy or Whoosh are designed for exactly this

  Cons:
  - Memory usage scales with number of tools
  - Less semantic understanding than embeddings
  - Requires careful index design

  Based on your example, I'd most strongly recommend options #4 and #5, possibly in combination, as they would deliver the fastest
  performance for your workflow while maintaining reasonable flexibility.

> Novel phrasing is key especially when tools need to call each other during a multi-step request. We can't always predict what 
  wording will be used.

⏺ You're absolutely right - handling novel phrasings is crucial, especially for multi-step workflows where tools might need to call
  each other with unpredictable wording. Given this requirement, let me refine my recommendations:

  1. Lightweight Semantic Embedding + Quantization

  Pros:
  - Maintains semantic understanding for novel phrasings
  - Uses smaller, specialized embedding models (MiniLM, BERT-tiny)
  - Vector quantization reduces dimensionality while preserving similarity
  - Can achieve 100-200ms response times with proper optimization
  - Works with any phrasing that conveys the same intent
  - Scales well to tool-to-tool communication patterns

  Cons:
  - Still requires some computation for embedding generation
  - Slightly higher latency than pure keyword approaches
  - Requires careful model selection for speed/accuracy tradeoff

  2. Semantic Caching with Fallback

  Pros:
  - Cache common semantic patterns and their matched tools
  - Instant response for similar requests (even with different wording)
  - Only compute new embeddings for truly novel requests
  - Gradually builds knowledge of common patterns
  - Can achieve <50ms for cached patterns while handling novel ones

  Cons:
  - Initial cold start performance
  - Cache management adds complexity
  - Determining semantic similarity threshold for cache hits

  3. Distilled Tool Matching Model

  Pros:
  - Train a tiny specialized model just for tool matching
  - Much faster than general LLM inference
  - Knowledge distillation from larger models preserves semantic understanding
  - Can be optimized for <100ms inference on CPU
  - Handles novel phrasings while being extremely focused on your domain

  Cons:
  - Requires training and maintaining a specialized model
  - Needs retraining when adding new tools
  - More complex implementation than simpler approaches

  4. Semantic Fingerprinting

  Pros:
  - Generate compact semantic "fingerprints" of tool capabilities
  - Much smaller than full embeddings (32-128 bits possible)
  - Extremely fast matching while preserving semantic similarity
  - Locality-sensitive hashing allows for sub-50ms matching
  - Works with novel phrasings expressing similar concepts

  Cons:
  - Some loss of precision compared to full embeddings
  - Requires careful fingerprint design
  - May need occasional recomputation of fingerprints

  5. Dynamic Threshold Hybrid System

  Pros:
  - Start with fastest methods (pattern matching)
  - Dynamically escalate to more semantic methods when confidence is low
  - Self-adjusting confidence thresholds based on success patterns
  - Can achieve both speed and flexibility in a single system
  - Adapts to both predictable and novel request patterns

  Cons:
  - Most complex implementation of all options
  - Requires tuning of escalation thresholds
  - Multiple matching strategies to maintain

  Given your emphasis on novel phrasing and tool-to-tool communication, I would most strongly recommend options #1 and #5. The
  lightweight semantic embedding approach will handle novel phrasings well, while the dynamic threshold system gives you a way to
  optimize performance without sacrificing flexibility.

  ⎿  Read 468 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Looking at your current implementation with MiniLM and considering your concern about the 2-3 second latency even on an M4 Mac, I
  can see several key opportunities for optimization:

  Optimized Approach: Tiered Matching System with Caching

  The current tool_finder_embed implementation has some good foundations but could be significantly optimized:

  1. Model Selection Problem: MiniLM is relatively small but still too heavy for this specific task that needs <100ms response time.
  2. Expensive Operations:
    - Full encoding of user queries at runtime
    - Updating embeddings on every run (_update_tool_embeddings)
    - Computing exact embeddings when approximate methods would suffice

  Here's a concrete optimized approach:

  1. Quantized Embeddings with Significantly Reduced Dimensions

  Pros:
  - Replace MiniLM with a truly tiny model like FastText
  - Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA) to compress vectors to 32-64 dims
  - Quantize vectors to 8-bit precision instead of 32-bit
  - These changes alone can reduce inference time by 10-20x

  Implementation:
  # Pre-compute once during initialization
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
  # Reduce dimensions drastically
  pca = PCA(n_components=32)
  reduced_embeddings = {tool: pca.transform(emb.reshape(1, -1))[0] for tool, emb in full_embeddings.items()}
  # Quantize to 8-bit integers (even more speed)
  quantized_embeddings = {tool: (emb * 127).astype(np.int8) for tool, emb in reduced_embeddings.items()}

  2. Two-tier Pattern Recognition (Millisecond First Pass)

  Pros:
  - First attempt fast pattern matching (regex/keywords) for common patterns (<5ms)
  - Skip embedding calculation entirely for obvious cases
  - Reserve semantic matching only for ambiguous cases

  Implementation:
  # Define common patterns keyed to tools
  TOOL_PATTERNS = {
      "email_tool": [r"\b(email|gmail|outlook|message|send)\b", r"\bcheck.*mail\b"],
      "kasa_tool": [r"\b(light|bulb|lamp|smart.?home|kasa)\b", r"\bturn (on|off).*light\b"],
      # Other tool patterns...
  }

  def fast_pattern_match(message):
      matches = {}
      for tool, patterns in TOOL_PATTERNS.items():
          for pattern in patterns:
              if re.search(pattern, message, re.IGNORECASE):
                  matches[tool] = 1.0  # High confidence match
                  return matches  # Return immediately on first match for speed
      return {}  # No pattern matches

  3. Asyncio Implementation

  Pros:
  - Make the embedding calculation async to prevent blocking
  - Start responding immediately while embeddings compute in background
  - This can reduce perceived latency significantly

  Implementation:
  import asyncio

  async def find_tools_async(message):
      # Start pattern matching and embedding calculation concurrently
      pattern_match_task = asyncio.create_task(fast_pattern_match(message))
      embedding_task = asyncio.create_task(calculate_embeddings(message))

      # Use pattern match result if available quickly
      pattern_result = await asyncio.wait_for(pattern_match_task, timeout=0.01)
      if pattern_result:
          # Cancel embedding calculation if not needed
          embedding_task.cancel()
          return pattern_result

      # Fall back to embedding results
      return await embedding_task

  4. Memoization for User Queries

  Pros:
  - Cache results for similar user queries
  - Use approximate matching for the cache lookup
  - Can achieve sub-millisecond responses for previously seen patterns

  Implementation:
  # LRU cache for query results with fuzzy key matching
  from functools import lru_cache
  import difflib

  class FuzzyLRUCache:
      def __init__(self, capacity=100, similarity_threshold=0.9):
          self.capacity = capacity
          self.cache = {}
          self.keys = []
          self.threshold = similarity_threshold

      def get(self, query):
          # Try exact match first
          if query in self.cache:
              return self.cache[query]

          # Try fuzzy match
          for key in self.keys:
              similarity = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, query, key).ratio()
              if similarity >= self.threshold:
                  return self.cache[key]

          return None

      def put(self, query, result):
          if len(self.keys) >= self.capacity:
              oldest = self.keys.pop(0)
              del self.cache[oldest]

          self.cache[query] = result
          self.keys.append(query)

  5. Precomputed Similarity Matrix

  Pros:
  - Precompute similarity between all tools during initialization
  - Use this to quickly prune the search space
  - Can reduce number of comparisons by 80-90%

  Implementation:
  def precompute_similarity_matrix():
      # Create a matrix of tool-to-tool similarity
      similarity_matrix = {}
      tools = list(tool_embeddings.keys())

      for i, tool1 in enumerate(tools):
          similarity_matrix[tool1] = {}
          for j, tool2 in enumerate(tools):
              if i != j:
                  sim = cosine_similarity(tool_embeddings[tool1], tool_embeddings[tool2])
                  similarity_matrix[tool1][tool2] = sim

      return similarity_matrix

  Using these optimizations combined, you should be able to reduce the latency from 2-3 seconds to under 100ms for most queries, with
   many common patterns resolving in 5-10ms. The approach maintains semantic understanding for novel phrasings while dramatically
  improving response time.

  The core insight is that for tool selection, you don't need the full power of MiniLM - a much more specialized, stripped-down
  approach using techniques specifically optimized for this task will perform better.
