    "description": "\n    Creates and manages automated tasks and sequences that run at scheduled times without user intervention.\n    Use this tool when the user wants to automate tasks, create workflows, or set up recurring activities.\n    \n    \n    This tool supports two types of automations:\n    \n    1. Simple Tasks: Execute a single operation at scheduled times\n       - Direct execution: Run a specific tool operation with predetermined parameters\n       - Orchestrated execution: Use Claude to interpret a task description and determine which tools to use\n       \n    2. Sequences: Execute a series of connected steps with data passing between them\n       - Each step can execute either directly or through Claude\n       - Support for conditional execution, error handling, and alternative paths\n       - Parameters can reference results from previous steps using template syntax\n    \n    The tool supports these operations:\n    \n    1. create_automation: Create a new task or sequence\n       - Required fields: name, type (simple_task or sequence), frequency\n       - For simple_task: execution_mode, tool_name/operation OR task_description\n       - For sequence: steps (list of step definitions)\n       - Optional: scheduled_time, day_of_week, day_of_month, timezone, etc.\n       \n       When creating automations, tools MUST stage the automation for future execution without performing immediate actions. Direct tool invocations during automation creation are prohibited and should be replaced by scheduling mechanisms.\n    \n    2. get_automations: List automations filtered by criteria\n       - Optional filters: type, status, frequency, limit, offset\n    \n    3. get_automation: Get detailed information about a specific automation\n       - Required: automation_id\n    \n    4. update_automation: Modify an existing automation\n       - Required: automation_id\n       - Optional: Any fields to update\n    \n    5. delete_automation: Remove an automation\n       - Required: automation_id\n       Explicit confirmation is required to delete an automation. DO NOT automatically set the value to true. Ask the user if they really want to delete the automation before setting true. AFTER the user confirms that they want to delete the automation set 'confirm=true' to proceed.\n    \n    6. execute_now: Run an automation immediately\n       - Required: automation_id\n       - Optional: initial_context (for sequences)\n    \n    7. pause_automation: Temporarily pause scheduled execution\n       - Required: automation_id\n    \n    8. resume_automation: Resume a paused automation\n       - Required: automation_id\n    \n    9. get_executions: View execution history for an automation\n       - Required: automation_id\n       - Optional: limit, offset\n    \n    10. get_execution_details: Get detailed information about a specific execution\n        - Required: execution_id\n    \n    This tool requires parameters to be passed as a JSON string in the \"kwargs\" field when using the direct APIs.\n    When interacting through Claude, you can use natural language to describe the automation you want to create.\n    \n    Examples:\n    - \"Create a daily reminder to check inventory at 9am\"\n    - \"Set up a weekly chain that generates a sales report and emails it to the team every Monday\"\n    - \"Make a sequence that processes customer data and sends personalized messages\"\n    ",

You can use this tool to collect information if you are confident that clarification cannot reasonably be collected in a single message. This tool also has access to predefined questionnaires for collecting customer details (customer_questionnaire.json) and a recipe generator (recipe_questionnaire.json)\nThis tool enables conducting comprehensive questionnaires with various customization options:\n\n1. Running Questionnaires:\n   - Use predefined questionnaires via 'questionnaire_id' parameter\n   - Create ad-hoc questionnaires with 'questions' parameter (simple string list)\n   - Design custom structured questionnaires with 'custom_questions' parameter\n   - Example: questionnaire_id=\"recipe\" or questions=[\"What's your name?\", \"Where do you live?\"]\n\n2. Question Types and Features:\n   - Simple text questions for free-form responses\n   - Multiple-choice questions with predefined options\n   - Dynamic question generation based on previous answers\n   - Preference key mapping for organizing responses with meaningful labels\n   - Automatic filtering of already-answered questions\n   \n3. Response Handling:\n   - Collects all responses locally without sending to LLM until complete\n   - Returns structured data with question/answer pairs\n   - Maps responses to semantic keys for easier preference management\n   - IMPORTANT: When presenting results, show only the raw data without interpretive commentary\n\nUse this tool whenever you need to gather multiple pieces of structured information from the user in a single interaction session.",
