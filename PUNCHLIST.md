	# MIRA Development Punchlist

## Overview
This punchlist organizes development tasks in dependency order, ensuring each task builds on a solid foundation established by previous work.

## Task Order & Justification

DONE !!!!! ### 1. ‚úÖ Documentation Cleanup
**Task**: Go through docs/ folder and clear out junk - establish current project understanding  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Justification**: Foundation task - understanding the current project state before making changes. No dependencies on other tasks. Provides clarity on existing standards/patterns.

DONE!!!!! ### 2. ‚úÖ FastAPI Server Completion
**Task**: Setup/complete FastAPI server - ensure API foundation is solid  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Justification**: Critical infrastructure that other components depend on. API layer should be solid before building features on top. Already partially implemented in `api/fastapi_app.py`.

DONE!!!! ### 3. ‚úÖ Embedding Infrastructure Migration
**Task**: Remove sentence-transformers and replace with onnx - core embedding infrastructure  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Justification**: Core infrastructure change affecting embeddings throughout the system. ONNX already set up in `onnx/` directory. Should be done early as it affects memory systems and tools.

### 4. ‚úÖ Multi-User Support with Magic Link Authentication
**Task**: Implement true multi-user support with siloed data and magic link authentication  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Justification**: Critical infrastructure that must be in place before production. Requires database schema updates to isolate user data (conversations, memory, automations, tool data). Magic link auth provides passwordless, secure authentication. Should be implemented early as it affects all data storage patterns going forward. Dependencies: FastAPI server (done), basic database structure.

### 6. ‚è≥ Tools Standardization
**Task**: Go through tools one-by-one to standardize - apply sample_tool.py patterns  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Justification**: Depends on having sample_tool.py as the blueprint. Must be done before generating classifier examples. Creates consistent interface for lt_memory integration.

### 5. ‚úÖ Reference Tool Implementation
**Task**: Create modern sample_tool.py - establish gold standard for all tools  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Justification**: Establishes the blueprint before updating other tools. No dependencies, but critical for next steps. Becomes the reference implementation for tool standardization.

### 7. ‚è≥ Classifier Examples Regeneration
**Task**: Remove old classifier examples and generate new ones - after tools standardized  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Justification**: Depends on standardized tools so examples match current implementation. Clean slate approach prevents confusion. Generator needs to use correct naming conventions.

### 8. ‚è≥ LT Memory Finalization
**Task**: Finalize lt_memory with LLM integration - leverage standardized components  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Justification**: Can now leverage standardized tools and onnx embeddings. Core component needed by automation engine. Benefits from having clean, standardized interfaces.

### 9. ‚è≥ Automation Engine Rebuild
**Task**: Rebuild automation engine - depends on finalized lt_memory  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Justification**: Depends heavily on finalized lt_memory. Can use all the standardized components. One of the most complex tasks, needs solid foundation.

### 10. üîÆ Topics System
**Task**: Explore topics concept (e.g., "email" is a topic, "recipe" is a topic)  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Justification**: New feature that builds on stable core. Lower priority experimental work. Can leverage all previous improvements.

### 11. üîÆ Topics/UI Integration
**Task**: Marry topics/workflows to UI streaming (show inbox count in email context, etc.)  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Justification**: Extends the topics feature. Requires topics to be defined first. Enhancement to user experience through contextual UI updates.

### 12. ‚è≥ Conversation Truncation & Storage
**Task**: Implement conversation truncation with full 1:1 storage and UUID-based retrieval  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Justification**: Prevents context overflow in long conversations while preserving full history. Needs database schema for conversation storage and UUID indexing. Should be done after core systems are stable but before heavy usage.

### 13. ‚è≥ Web Interface UX Improvements
**Task**: Implement retry send population, loading screen fixes, and expandable input  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Justification**: User experience enhancements for the web interface. Depends on stable core systems.
- Retry sends should populate the input field and then the user can send them as they please
- The loading screen overlay should not cover the whole interface (even though its transparent) because then I can't click anything while its loading
- The loading screen first and last char spots need to be populated every time. This gives visual symmetry to the loading screen
- The input box needs to expand as the user writes longer text that becomes multiline


## Legend
- ‚úÖ Ready to start (no blocking dependencies)
- ‚è≥ Waiting on dependencies
- üîÆ Future enhancements

## Notes
- Each task should be marked complete before moving to dependent tasks
- High priority items form the critical path for project stability
- Low priority items are enhancements that can be deferred if needed
