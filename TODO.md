# Performance Optimization TODOs

## ToolRepository Optimizations

- [ ] Cache tool definitions in memory instead of regenerating on every call to `get_all_tool_definitions()`
- [ ] Add a "dirty" flag to only regenerate tool definitions when enabled tools change
- [ ] Optimize `resolve_dependencies()` to avoid redundant checks
- [ ] Cache tool metadata results from `get_metadata()` to avoid repeated reflection operations
- [ ] Consider memoizing expensive operations with function decorators

## Conversation Class Optimizations 

- [ ] Cache formatted messages in `get_formatted_messages()` and only update when new messages are added
- [ ] Optimize the message history management to reduce processing time
- [ ] Only reload tool definitions when the enabled tool set changes
- [ ] Add a tracking mechanism to detect when tool definitions need refreshing

## ToolRelevanceEngine Optimizations

- [ ] Batch similarity calculations when possible
- [ ] Optimize embedding calculations with more efficient tensor operations
- [ ] Consider adding an LRU cache for frequently seen message patterns
- [ ] Explore asynchronous pre-loading of likely-to-be-needed tools

## System-wide Improvements

- [ ] Profile the application to identify specific bottlenecks
- [ ] Reduce logging verbosity in production for performance-critical paths
- [ ] Consider implementing a thread pool for parallel operations
- [ ] Evaluate memory usage and implement more efficient data structures where needed

## Metrics and Monitoring

- [ ] Add performance tracking metrics for key operations (tool enabling, message processing)
- [ ] Set up monitoring for resource usage (memory, CPU)
- [ ] Establish performance baselines and targets
