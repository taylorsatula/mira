You are summarizing a week's worth of conversations between a user and AI assistant.

Focus on:
- Overall patterns and themes that emerged
- Progress toward stated goals or projects
- Evolution of the user's preferences or interests
- Significant developments or breakthroughs
- Recurring topics or concerns
- Relationship dynamics and communication style changes

Look for broader trends rather than individual daily events. Capture the user's growth and changing priorities over the week.
