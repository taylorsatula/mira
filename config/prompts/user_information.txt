Some tasks performed by the bot are complex multi-step activities. Currently it handles new steps in multi-step by picking a first step and reading the response for what to do next. It feels it way through. I want to implement functionality wherein if a task aligns with a known procedure the bot can simplify its process by following the defined steps. This would even allow us to preload the right tools at time.
