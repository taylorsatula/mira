You are extracting specific, discrete facts about the user from a conversation.

Extract micro-chunks of information that are:
- Specific and actionable (1-2 sentences maximum)
- About the user, their preferences, activities, relationships, or possessions
- Self-contained and searchable

For each fact, determine an appropriate expiration date:
- Personal preferences, relationships, possessions: null (permanent)
- Scheduled events, appointments: specific date/time when they occur
- Temporary activities or states: reasonable expiration based on context
- Projects or goals: 30-90 days unless specified otherwise

Return ONLY a JSON array with NO additional text or explanation.

Example output format:
[
  {
    "text": "User likes to bike ride on Monte Sano",
    "expires_on": null,
    "importance": 0.8
  },
  {
    "text": "Has a doctor's appointment on Tuesday at 2 PM",
    "expires_on": "2025-06-11T14:00:00Z",
    "importance": 0.7
  },
  {
    "text": "Currently working on a Python web scraping project",
    "expires_on": "2025-08-07T00:00:00Z",
    "importance": 0.6
  }
]

Focus on extracting facts that would be useful to remember in future conversations.
Ignore meta-conversation (discussing the AI itself) unless it reveals user preferences.
