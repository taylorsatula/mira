LT_Memory Future Enhancements & TODOs

  High Priority Enhancements

  Memory Processing & Intelligence
  - LLM-based summarization - Replace simple concatenation in _summarize_chunk() with proper LLM summarization for better memory
  compression
  - Intelligent memory importance scoring - Use LLM to assess memory importance rather than simple keyword/length heuristics
  - Memory conflict resolution - Implement system to handle contradictory memories and maintain truth hierarchy
  - Cross-conversation pattern mining - Detect patterns and insights across multiple conversations automatically

  Entity & Relationship Intelligence
  - Advanced NER with spaCy/LLM - Replace regex-based entity extraction with proper NLP models
  - Relationship type classification - Use LLM to classify relationship types beyond simple co-occurrence
  - Entity disambiguation - Detect when same entity appears with different names (e.g., "John" vs "John Smith")
  - Knowledge graph reasoning - Infer new relationships based on existing graph structure

  Medium Priority Enhancements

  Performance & Scalability
  - Memory hierarchies - Implement hot/warm/cold storage tiers based on access patterns
  - Distributed processing - Support for multi-node memory processing for large deployments
  - Advanced vector indexing - Implement HNSW or other advanced indexes for better search performance
  - Memory compression - Compress older memories while preserving searchability

  Advanced Memory Features
  - Temporal memory queries - "What did we discuss last Tuesday?" style time-based retrieval
  - Memory decay simulation - Gradually reduce importance of old, unused memories
  - Context-aware retrieval - Surface memories based on current conversation context
  - Memory clustering - Group related memories into topics/themes automatically

  User Experience
  - Memory visualization interface - Web UI to explore knowledge graph and memory relationships
  - Memory export/import - Allow users to backup and restore their memory state
  - Memory privacy controls - Fine-grained control over what gets remembered vs forgotten
  - Memory search interface - Allow users to directly query their memory system

  Low Priority / Research Items

  Advanced AI Features
  - Multi-modal memory - Support for image, audio, and video memories
  - Federated memory - Share knowledge graphs across multiple MIRA instances
  - Memory-guided response generation - Use memory context to improve response quality
  - Personality drift detection - Track how user personality/preferences change over time

  Integration & Compatibility
  - External knowledge integration - Connect to external APIs (Wikipedia, etc.) for fact verification
  - Memory versioning - Track how memories evolve and change over time

  Technical Debt & Code Quality

  Testing & Validation
  - Integration tests with real PostgreSQL - Test with actual database instead of mocks
  - Performance benchmarks - Establish baseline performance metrics for different scales
  - Memory leak detection - Ensure embedding cache and other components don't grow unboundedly
  - Stress testing - Test system behavior with thousands of conversations

  Documentation & Maintenance
  - API documentation - Complete OpenAPI spec for all memory endpoints
  - Migration scripts - Tools for migrating between different memory system versions
  - Monitoring dashboards - Grafana/Prometheus dashboards for memory system health
  - Backup/recovery procedures - Documented procedures for memory system disaster recovery

  Note: Many of these enhancements build on the solid foundation we've created. The current implementation already handles the core
   MemGPT functionality and provides a robust platform for these future improvements.
