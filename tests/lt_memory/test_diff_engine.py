"""
Production-grade tests for DiffEngine differential versioning system.

This test suite focuses on realistic production scenarios that matter for
reliability. We test the contracts and behaviors that users actually depend on,
not theoretical edge cases that will never occur.

Testing philosophy:
1. Test the public API contracts that users rely on
2. Test critical private methods that could fail in subtle ways
3. Focus on scenarios that actually happen in production
4. Avoid impossible scenarios that would force unnecessary defensive coding
