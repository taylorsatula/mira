"""
Production-grade tests for ConversationArchive.

Testing philosophy: TEST THE CONTRACT, NOT THE IMPLEMENTATION
Before every test: "What real production bug in OUR CODE would this catch?"

The ConversationArchive manages temporal storage and retrieval of conversation history.
We test the public contracts that users depend on: archiving daily conversations,
retrieving them by date/range, and generating progressive summaries.

Testing approach:
1. Use real PostgreSQL database (same engine as production)
2. Test public API contracts that users rely on
3. Test critical private methods that could fail in subtle ways
4. Focus on date handling, message filtering, and summary generation
5. Test error handling and edge cases
6. Verify database persistence and retrieval accuracy
